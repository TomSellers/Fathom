0.98    The lost years...


0.97	2010.11.07

    Scanning: Package now includes scanning and maintenance shell scripts for generating data and keeping it up to date.
    Scanning: Set --host-timeout to 10 minutes in scan-full.sh, scan-recon.sh and scan-genlogs.sh to limit impact of slow hosts.
	
    Search: Added -m / --mac-address to search by MAC address or MAC vendor string. This will use results from nbstat.nse if the MAC data isn't present but nbstat data is.
        Thanks to Ron Bowes (www.skullsecurity.org) for this idea.

    Output:	 Cleanup of tabular (default) output from port and OS queries
    
    General: Renamed scripts and files to use dash "-" instead of underscore for usability and consistency.
    General: Cleanup of --metrics code to handle hashes more efficiently
         
    Data Maint:	util-cleanup.rb - Added IP address based selection of files to move to the backup directory
    Data Maint: util-cleanup.rb - Added --purge command to delete backup directory contents

    BUG: Fixed a issue in Fathom where --script-data was not searching host script output.

    Cleanup: Code cleanup and efficiency changes
    	     Thanks to Kris Katterjohn
    	
    BUG: Fixed directory specification and options order issue
    	 Thanks to David Fifield
    
    Metrics: Added counts for service product
    
    Output: Added -r / --report option to specify output file
        All query results will be written to this file
        
    Input: Changed -l / --log to handle individual files as well as directories
    	   Long option is now --log instead of --log-dir
    	   Clarified error message when input XML file does not exist
        
    Output Filter: Added --ip-filter to permit filtering of output
    	by host IP address, takes single host, IP/CIDR and IP/netmask notation 
    	The metrics and all host outputs respect this filter

    Output Filter: Added --start-date and --end-date to permit filtering of
    	output to just scans that occurred before or after specified dates.
    	The metrics and all host outputs respect this filter
    	
    Output Filter: Added --exclude-os to permit filtering of output 
    	by host OS.  Usefulness depends on if Nmap was requested to perform
    	OS identification and the accuracy of the result.
    	
    General: Improved grouping and format of -h output    	
    General: Improved error handling when an Interrupt is sent (Control-C)
    Cleanup: Collapsed -a/--all method into special case of os_search
    	
0.95	2010.06.26

    Changed format of -a / --all to include more data on OS family, type
    Updated fp-list -s / --service to allow optional service name parameter (http, ftp, etc)
    Updated fp-list CSV output to include service name
    Flag -m has been changed to -e (--exclude-port)
    Added --script-data to search for text in NSE script output or title
    	Honors port, service name and OS exclusion flags
    

0.94
    Name change from nQuery to fathom
    Added ability to query for all hosts in the logs (-a / --all-hosts)
    	Updated --metrics to include count of hosts that were up
    Added -v/--version to report program and supporting library versions
0.93

    Updated to use Nmap::Parser 0.3.5
    Converted command line parsing to use OptionParser
    	Cleaner results, built in -h result
    Change port logic to use getports
    Changed date format, added timestamp as parameter to gen_output
    Improved error handling
    	Moved error messages so that they all occur after the query result output
    Improved service and port result exclusion (-x / -m)
    Added ability to specify log directory via command line
    Added service name to -s / --service query logic, was just searching Product and Extra Info values
    Added ability to generate port, service, host and OS statistics (--metrics)
    	--metrics takes optional number indicating results count to return
    Fixed CSV output, standardized in fp-list.rb, tailored in fathom.rb
